# Hamlog 2 (in development)
Hamlog 2 is the successor to my original Hamlog application. Some of the key differences over the previous version is the use of server-side rendering and MongoDB over MySQL.

## Development Plan
Hamlog 2 will be deployed globally and won't require the user to install a client in order to use the application. I've integrated my existing authentication system into Hamlog 2 and will support user account creation.
To add additional flexibility, I'd like to not only add a server-rendered frontend, but also an API for developers to use to integrate their logbook into existing future applications.

## Open Source
If you'd like to deploy your own instance of Hamlog 2, please do so. You should be familiar with JavaScript, Nodejs, Express, and the packages listed in package.json. If you'd like to contribute code to help development, I'd greatly appreciate it.
